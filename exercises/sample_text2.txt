Twitter has major security problems that pose a threat to its own users' personal information, to company 
shareholders, to national security, and to democracy, according to an explosive whistleblower disclosure obtained 
exclusively by CNN and The Washington Post.

The disclosure, sent last month to Congress and federal agencies, paints a picture of a chaotic and reckless 
environment at a mismanaged company that allows too many of its staff access to the platform's central controls and 
most sensitive information without adequate oversight. It also alleges that some of the company's senior-most 
executives have been trying to cover up Twitter's serious vulnerabilities, and that one or more current employees 
may be working for a foreign intelligence service.

The whistleblower, who has agreed to be publicly identified, is Peiter "Mudge" Zatko, who was previously the 
company's head of security, reporting directly to the CEO. Zatko further alleges that Twitter's leadership has 
misled its own board and government regulators about its security vulnerabilities, including some that could 
allegedly open the door to foreign spying or manipulation, hacking and disinformation campaigns. The whistleblower 
also alleges Twitter does not reliably delete users' data after they cancel their accounts, in some cases because 
the company has lost track of the information, and that it has misled regulators about whether it deletes the data 
as it is required to do. The whistleblower also says Twitter executives don't have the resources to fully 
understand the true number of bots on the platform, and were not motivated to. Bots have recently become central to 
Elon Musk's attempts to back out of a $44 billion deal to buy the company (although Twitter denies Musk's claims).
